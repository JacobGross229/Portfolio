<h1>Welcome to my blog!!!<h1>
    <p>This is where you can see my progression, struggles, wins, and losses when it comes to codeing this site.
       I'm starting this off from scratch with no help unless I get stuck. I also won't be using an AI tools because I believe that it will hinder my learning.
       The goal is to work on this 5 days a week for a minimum of 1hr a day 5 days a week.
       This isn't going to be easy by any means but it will be a learning experience.
       I've been stuck in tutorial video hell and I said enough is enough and I'm just going to do it.<p>

    <p>Day 1 01/14/2025: I'm getting everything set up and planning on how to format my site. 
        The design part is harder than I thought, but looking at examples help.
        At least for now I'm planning on just writing the blog in the HTML code. 
        Every day I work on this I'm gonna blog it with truggles and what not.
        This is my first real project. I don't want to touch AI when working on this I pretty much want it all the be raw code from me.
        If I get stuck I'm going to Google it and not solely rely on AI.
        I'm learning how the process works and how to overcome challenges.
        For now I'm thinking this will be pretty bare until I finish the more iportant pages.<p>
